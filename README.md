# Budget Tracker Starter Code

This is a budget tracker able to track despotis and withdrawals with or without internet/data connection. 

When a user makes a deposit or withdrawal offline, that data is stored locally through indexedDB. When they reestablish an internet connection, they are notified that they're transaction has been submitted, and their transaction history and totals are updated.

The application is also connected to a service worker and a web manifest.
